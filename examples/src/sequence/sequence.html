			<font face="Comic Sans MS" size=1><b>Rules:</b><br>
			In this game you are dealt 5 cards from the deck
			and you use them to cover up squares on the game board
			with your tiles (black). You try to get runs of 5 of your
			tiles in a row, and if you get 3 such runs then you win
			the game. Gameplay progresses by playing a card, placing/removing
			the appropriate tiles from the board, and then drawing a new card.
			After each of your plays the computer will play, using his tiles (<font color="red">red</font>).
			If you play a card that is not a Jack, you must then place one of your
			tiles on the board on a square that corresponds to the card you picked.
			If you play a Jack, then you can do one of 2 things:<br>
			1) You can place a tile on any unused square on the board.<br>
			2) You can remove one of the computer's tiles that has not been frozen.<br>
			If you make a run of 5 tiles in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally),
			then those tiles form a sequence and the tiles in that sequence
			are frozen. This means that they cannot be removed by your opponent playing a Jack.
			While forming a sequence requires 5 tiles in a row, no sequence can intersect
			another already-formed sequence by more than 1 tile. It may intersect multiple other
			sequences, but it can have at most one tile from any other sequence in itself.
