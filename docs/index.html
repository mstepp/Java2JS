    <h1>Java2JS: A Java bytecode to JavaScript compiler</h1>
    
    <p>
      This document describes the design and implementation of the
      Java2JS tool, which statically compiles Java bytecode (.class
      files) into JavaScript source code.

    <hr/>
    <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>
      Java2JS translates compiled Java code (.class files) into
      JavaScript modules (.js files).  The fact that we operate on
      compiled Java code means that we gain the benefit of knowing
      that the Java program passed all the compiler checks, and hence
      is valid code. As such, most of the standard well-formedness
      checks are not performed on the generated JavaScript code.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="features">Feature List</a></h2>
    <p>
      The JavaScript form of the compiled Java code has all of the
      same features of the Java language except for a few. Specifically, we can support:
      <ul>
        <li>interfaces</li>
        <li>int and long arithmetic</li>
        <li>inheritance</li>
        <li>arrays</li>
        <li>native methods</li>
        <li>limited reflection</li>
        <li>static initializers</li>
      </ul>
      More to the point, there are one or two things that we cannot
      support, mostly because of inherent restrictions of the
      JavaScript language. In particular, these include
      multi-threading and all synchronization primitives.  We can
      support reflection, but it is not fully
      implemented. Essentially, most of the elaborate uses of
      reflection rely on native methods. These methods could be
      implemented using our native method interface, so the
      enthusiastic user could implement as much reflection
      functionality as they wanted.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="compilation">Compilation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Here we outline some of the details of the compilation process.
      Each class file is compiled into a single JavaScript source
      file.  Each JavaScript source file contains a single class
      definition, which is a function that, when called, returns
      JavaScript class. This class can be used to create instances of
      objects, just like a Java class.  Once a class is defined, is it
      placed in a global object hierarchy rooted at the "Packages"
      object.  So for example, the <span class="code">java.lang.String</span> class would be
      defined in the <span class="code">Packages.java.lang.String</span> object.  This object
      is a function that returns the class definition, so really
      <span class="code">Packages.java.lang.String()</span> is the
      class definition. To create a new instance of String, you would call 
      <span class="code">Packages.java.lang.String().newInstance()</span>. This
      creates a new uninitialized instanceof String, just like the NEW
      Java bytecode operator. Before this String can be used you must
      call a constructor on it. This brings us to the notion of methods and fields.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="methods">Methods</a></h3> 
    <p>
      Methods are defined as direct properties of an object
      instance. The method property name is equal to the Java method's
      name concatenated to its signature. The Java type signature
      specification is
      defined <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se5.0/html/ClassFile.doc.html#1169">here</a>.
      So, the method object corresponding to the Java
      method <span class="code">String.indexOf(String,int)</span>
      would be
      <span class="code">Packages.java.lang.String().prototype["indexOf(Ljava/lang/String;I)I"]</span>. Or,
      for any given String instance str, it would be
      <span class="code">str["indexOf(Ljava/lang/String;I)I"]</span>.
      This will be a JavaScript function object that takes 2
      arguments, and expects the 'this' parameter to be bound to the
      String instance. Similarly, a static method would be accessed
      directly off the class definition and not off a particular
      instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constructors are no different in this scheme; they are just
      methods named "&lt;init&gt;" that always return void.  Once an
      object instance is created with newInstance(), it is considered
      uninitialized until one of its constructors is called. An
      uninitialized object should not have any methods called on it,
      nor should any fields be accessed. Compiled Java bytecode must
      obey this restriction; bytecode that violates it does not verify
      and will not run. The JavaScript implementation does not check
      for this and will not throw an exception. Calling newInstance()
      will cause the class to be initialized
      (see <a href="#initialization">initialization</a>).
    </p>

    <h3><a name="fields">Fields</a></h3>
    <p>
      Fields are also accessed directly off the object instance.
      However, the field property name is slightly different than the
      method property name.  To make the field property name for a
      particular Java field, you concatenate its name with a period
      (".") and then its type signature. So, for a String field named
      "foo", the property name would be
      <span class="code">foo.Ljava/lang/String;</span>.  Just like in
      Java, fields are implemented to their default values. For object
      types this is null, for numeric types it is numeric 0, for
      booleans it is false.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="primitives">Primitive Types</a></h3>
    <p>
      We support all Java primitive types, with one minor exception;
      floats are implemented as doubles. This is because all
      JavaScript numeric values are implicitly doubles, so it was just
      easier that way. That aside, we faithfully implement int and
      long arithmetic. Primitive ints are instances of the Integer
      class defined in <span class="code">int.js</span> (this is a
      normal-style JavaScript class named Integer, not the
      java.lang.Integer equivalent). Similarly, primitive long
      integers are defined by the Long class defined
      in <span class="code">long.js</span>. These objects cannot be
      manipulated with the built-in JavaScript arithmetic
      operators. Instead, there are methods defined to perform all the
      usual operations. For instance, adding primitive ints A and B is
      done by calling <span class="code">A.add(B)</span>, which
      returns a new Integer object. In general, Integers and Longs are
      considered immutable (even though their inner fields are quite
      mutable).
      
      Since floats and doubles are implemented by native JavaScript
      numbers, they can be manipulated using the built-in JavaScript
      operators.

      In JavaScript we use null to represent Java's null. JavaScript's
      undefined value does not correspond to any Java value.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="types">Type Descriptors</a></h3>
    <p>
      Type descriptors are used in a few places in our implementation,
      primarily in telling arrays what their types are. Type
      descriptors are defined
      in <span class="code">arrayobject.js</span> and come in 3 types:
      primitive, object, and array.  A primitive type represents one
      of the 8 Java primitive types, and also VOID.  An object type is
      actually an object class definition. An array type names an
      element type. Whenever a new array is created, it must be given
      a type descriptor object to tell it what its type is. Just like
      in Java, arrays are subclasses of Object.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="arrays">Arrays</a></h3>
    <p>
      Arrays are created by creating instances of the ArrayObject class.
      They are created with a length and a type descriptor.
      For example, to create an array of Strings of length 10, one would call
      <span class="code">new ArrayObject(10, new
      ArrayType(Packages.java.lang.String()))</span>.
      Since arrays are Objects, you can call any of the Object methods on them.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="initialization">Initialization</a></h3>
    <p>
      Class initialization happens when a class is first "used". This
      includes the first instantiation (call to newInstance()), the
      first static method call, or the first static field access.
      Initialization causes the supertypes of a class to be
      initialized recursively. Once they are initialized, the original
      class' static initializer block is executed (if any). This is
      the method named <span class="code">&lt;clinit&gt;()V</span>.
      Class initialization happens only once for any given class/interface.
    </p>



    <!--     CLASSLOADING    -->
    <hr/>
    <h2><a name="classloading">Dynamic Class Loading</a></h2>
    <p>
      Just like in Java, we support dynamic classloading. This is done
      through dynamic synchronous script injection at the point when a
      new class is first
      referenced. The <span class="code">Util.resolveClass(string)</span>
      method will use the system classloader to attempt to dynamically
      load the given class, if it is not already loaded into the
      object hierarchy. This requires that the system classloader is
      defined and set. To define the system classloader,
      call <span class="code">Util.setClassLoader(classloader)</span>.
      Classloader objects are defined
      in <span class="code">classloader.js</span>. The basic mechanism
      is that you must define a URL that can take accept a query
      string such as "?class=java.lang.String". It should then return
      the text that results from running the Java2JS compiler on the
      given class. The <span class="code">classloader.php</span>
      script is a simple example of this, which simply calls the
      provided Makefile to generate the named class, and then does a
      passthru of the JavaScript.
    </p>


    <!--     NATIVE METHODS    -->
    <hr/>
    <h2><a name="native">Native Methods</a></h2>
    <p>
      Our system supports native methods to be written in pure
      JavaScript code.  A native method implementation is registered
      through the <span class="code">Util.register_native(classname,
      methodname, func)</span> method. This is best described by example. We will define the method
      <span class="code">java.lang.System.arraycopy(Object src, int
      srcPos, Object dest, int destPos, int length)</span>.
      We can do this as follows:

      <pre>
        Util.register_native("java.lang.System", "arraycopy(Ljava/lang/Object;ILjava/lang/Object;II)V", 
                             function(src, srcPos, dest, destPos, length) {
                                length = length.toJS();
                                srcPos = srcPos.toJS();
                                destPos = destPos.toJS();
                                for (var i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
                                   dest.set(i + destPos, src.get(i + srcPos));
                                }
                             });
      </pre>

      Inside this function, the ints would be implemented as the
      JavaScript Integer objects described above. The "toJS" function
      converts the Integer value to an equivalent native JavaScript
      number. One final detail is that the 'this' reference of the
      function you provide will be bound to the target object, just
      like in Java (for non-static methods).
